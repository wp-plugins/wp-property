#### My theme is not working... HELP
Because there are so many different themes available for WP, not all of them will work flawlessly out of the box.  You can either customize your own theme, contact us for a theme customization quote or purchase one of our premium themes such as the Denali or Madison.

#### Is the plugin available in different languages?
Due to contributions from the plugin users we currently have it in Danish, German, English, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Brazilian, Russian, Slovak, Turkish translations. If you would like to translate the plugin in your own languages please email us the files when you are done so we can include them in future updates.

#### Side Bar disappears
This is a theme issue. Once again you can customize your own theme, email us and we can give you a quote or you can purchase the Denali premium theme.

#### How do stylesheets work?
The plugin uses your theme's stylesheet, but also has its own. Inside the plugin folder (wp-content/plugins/wp-property/templates) there is a file called "wp_properties.css". Copy that file to your template directory, and the plugin will automatically switch to using the settings in that file, and will not load the default one anymore. That way when you upgrade the plugin, your custom CSS will not be overwritten. Same goes for all the other template files.

#### How do I upload property images?
You would do it the same way as if you were editing a post or a page.  On the property editing page, click the Image icon above the content area, and upload images into the media library.  If you want the images to show up on the front-end, you may want to visit Appearance -> Widgets and setup the Property Gallery widget to show up on the property page.

#### How do I suggest an idea?
You can send us a message via our website, or, preferably, visit our [feedback.usabilitydynamics.com](http://feedback.usabilitydynamics.com/forums/95259-wp-property) page to submit new, and vote on existing, ideas.

#### I like where this is going, but how do I get customization?
If you submit a popular idea on UserVoice, we WILL integrate it sooner or later.  If you need something custom, and urgent, [contact us](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/contact-us)
